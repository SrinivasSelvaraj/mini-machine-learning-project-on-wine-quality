Wine Quality Prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict the quality of wines based on various features. The dataset used for this project is the Wine Quality Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Dataset
The dataset contains various physicochemical properties of red and white wine samples, along with their quality ratings. The features include attributes such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/SrinivasSelvaraj
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
cd wine-quality-prediction
Install the required dependencies:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
jupyter notebook wine_quality_prediction.ipynb
Follow the instructions in the notebook to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, train the machine learning model, and evaluate its performance.

Results
The trained model achieves an accuracy of X% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting wine quality based on the given features
